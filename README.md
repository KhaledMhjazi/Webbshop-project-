# Webbshop-project-
The project involves creating a website for Alice's new business, which sells technical devices for health tracking and smart homes. The goal is to improve the website's look and feel by implementing CSS styles to make it more attractive to customers and visitors.

The primary language to be used for this project is HTML for creating the website's structure and content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and enhancing the visual elements of the website. This combination of HTML and CSS is commonly used to build and design websites.
